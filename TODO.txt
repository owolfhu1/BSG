Eric, help me add to this list (or remove things you may have done)


TODO list:

- EVASIVE MANEUVERS - setup a pause after viper is attacked for this skill card

- character one time abilities:
    - Karl "Helo" Agathon
    - Sharon "Boomer" Valerii
            - ui needs to show 'middle' button only when relevant

- character limitations:
    - Karl "Helo" Agathon

 - character advantages:
     - Lee Adama
     - Karl "Helo" Agathon
        - needs ui
            - when phase is .HELO_REROLL, helo can send command 'reroll' to do a reroll.

Game misc todo:
-Legendary discovery crisis card (need to add to destinations on pass)
-Weapon malfunction crisis card (need special step to remove vipers in space)
-Authorization of Brutal Force Quorum Card (need special step to choose what to remove and where)
-Fleet mobilization super crisis card (needs to trigger each cylon activation)
-Placing cylon ships step: invalid message and often skips parts including placement step and crashes often
-You are a cylon aaron, make new damage choice system, with graphics or checkmarks
-Super crisis cards should not be affected by character abilities (might be ok already)
-Skills cards that make current player discard or otherwise affect the current player should not affect revealed cylons
-Cylon attack cards place ships step often skips or crashes
-Decks reshuffling correctly when empty? (i.e. civilian)
-Do game over

Need roll pause for strategic planning:
-Cylon ships attacking (base star/raiders attacking vipers or galactica)

UI:
-Die roll is inconsistent in adding strategic planning to die graphic or not
-Clicking hand cards and other actions sometimes hides choice ui
-Ships fit to space area
-Show skill card decks at bottom (for realism, though you canâ€™t click them)
-General cleanup of layout
-Start game form needs work
